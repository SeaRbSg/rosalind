# Given: A permutation of at most 12 symbols defining an ordered
#        alphabet A and a positive integer n (n≤4 ).
#
# Return: All strings of length at most n formed from A, ordered
#         lexicographically. (Note: As in “Enumerating k-mers
#         Lexicographically”, alphabet order is based on the order in
#         which the symbols are given.)
