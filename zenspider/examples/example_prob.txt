# Given: A DNA string s of length at most 100 bp and an array A
#        containing at most 20 numbers between 0 and 1.
#
# Return: An array B having the same length as A in which B[k]
#         represents the common logarithm of the probability that a
#         random string constructed with the GC-content found in A[k]
#         will match s exactly.
