# Problem

# In "Counting Subsets", we saw that the total number of subsets of a
# set S containing n elements is equal to 2n.

# However, if we intend to count the total number of subsets of S having a fixed size k, then we use the combination statistic C(n,k), also written (nk).

# Given:
# Positive integers n and m with 0 <= m <= n <= 2000.

# Return:
# The sum of combinations C(n,k) for all k satisfying m <= k <= n,
# modulo 1,000,000. In shorthand, sum(nk)=m(nk).

# Sample Dataset
# 6 3

# Sample Output
# 42
